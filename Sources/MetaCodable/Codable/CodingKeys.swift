/// struct CodableType {
///     let productName: String
///     let productCost: String
///     let description: String
/// }

/// The ``Codable()`` macro generated code will transform field names
/// to snake-case in the `Codable` implementation.
///
/// - Parameter strategy: The case strategy `CodingKey`.
///
/// - Note: The case strategy is only used to transform field names to
///   `CodingKey`s. `CodingKey`s provided with ``CodedIn(_:)``,
///   ``CodedAt(_:)`` will remain unchanged.
///
/// - Note: This macro on its own only validates if attached declaration
///   is a variable declaration. ``Codable()`` macro uses this macro
///   when generating final implementations.
///
/// - Important: This attribute must be used combined with ``Codable()``.
